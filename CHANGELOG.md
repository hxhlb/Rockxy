## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- Uinitial open-source release of Rockxy
## 2026-03-22

### Added

- Diff integration: select exactly 2 transactions in the request list, right-click "Compare Selected" to open the diff window with both transactions loaded for side-by-side comparison of headers, body, and timing; also available via Diff > Compare Selected menu (Cmd+Option+D)
- Session metadata dialog after opening a `.rockxysession` file: shows transaction count, log entry count, capture date range, and Rockxy version that saved the session
- Scripting window empty state: explains what JavaScript scripting does, lists capabilities (modify headers, inspect responses, block patterns, mock responses), and provides a "Create Your First Script" button
- Script sidebar error visibility: plugins in error state now show the error message inline (red text, tooltip) instead of just a version number; loading state shows "Loading..." label
- Script console surfaces load-time errors: plugins that fail during initial load now emit error entries to the console automatically
- Specific error messages for script timeouts and JS exceptions in the scripting console, with actionable hints (e.g., "Check for infinite loops")
- "Edit and Repeat" replay sheet: right-click context menu now splits "Repeat" (fast replay) from "Edit and Repeat" (opens editable sheet with method, URL, headers, body editing and inline response display)
- Unified rule management: `MapLocalWindowView`, `MapRemoteWindowView`, and `BlockListWindowView` now route all mutations through `RuleSyncService` instead of using private `RuleStore` instances; all windows subscribe to `.rulesDidChange` notifications for cross-window consistency
- `RuleEngine.updateRule(_:)`, `replaceAll(_:)`, `setEnabled(id:enabled:)` methods for granular and batch rule mutations
- `RuleSyncService.updateRule(_:)`, `replaceAllRules(_:)`, `setRuleEnabled(id:enabled:)` methods with automatic persist + notification broadcast
- Persistent direct-mode proxy backup (`DirectProxyBackup` plist) survives crashes and force-quits; written before any `networksetup` mutation, cleared after successful restore
- Launch-time stale proxy recovery: `recoverStaleProxyIfNeeded()` detects and restores leftover Rockxy proxy overrides on app launch (discards backups older than 24 hours)
- Ownership-aware `disableSystemProxy()` via `effectiveOverrideOwner()`: detects whether the proxy is owned by direct mode or helper, restores from in-memory state or disk backup, and handles partial failure without losing the backup
- Partial failure rollback in `enableSystemProxyViaNetworkSetup`: if any service fails mid-setup, already-mutated services are rolled back to their original state
- `HelperConnection.getProxyStatus()` async wrapper for querying helper proxy state
- Response breakpoints: proxy pipeline now intercepts upstream responses when breakpoint phase is `.response` or `.both`, buffers the full response, pauses for user editing (status code, headers, body), and forwards the modified response via `BreakpointResponseBuilder`; works for both HTTP and HTTPS traffic
- Editable query parameters in breakpoint editor: the Query tab now shows editable name/value TextFields with add/remove buttons instead of read-only text; edits sync back to the draft URL in real time
- "Add Breakpoint for Selected Request" command in Tools menu and toolbar breakpoint dropdown: creates a regex-based breakpoint rule matching the selected transaction's host and path
- Breakpoints window (`Cmd+Shift+B`) with queue-backed `BreakpointManager`: supports multiple simultaneous paused requests, two-column layout (queue list + editor), per-item resolve or bulk resolve-all, elapsed time tracking, and toolbar indicator with paused count
- Live bandwidth metering in the footer status bar: cumulative upload/download totals, instantaneous throughput via 1-second sliding window with 250ms decay timer, and tooltips on speed indicators
- Helper tool `unreachable` status with XPC diagnostic properties (`installedVersion`, `isReachable`, `registrationStatus`, `lastErrorMessage`, `isBusy`) and `retryConnection()`/`reinstall()` actions
- Advanced Proxy Settings helper section redesigned with 3-zone layout: summary row with status-mapped icons/colors/subtitles, diagnostics grid (bundled vs installed version, registration status, XPC reachability), conditional error detail, and state-dependent action buttons with inline progress indicator
- Uninstall confirmation alert for helper tool removal in Advanced Proxy Settings
- Deferred settings controls in General, Tools, and Advanced tabs now visually disabled (`.disabled(true)` + `.opacity(0.6)`) with "(Preview)" labels so users can see planned features without confusing them for functional settings
- Behavior-oriented settings wiring tests covering `NoCacheHeaderMutator.isEnabled` integration and `ImportSizePolicy` oversized-file rejection, replacing shallow UserDefaults round-trip tests
- `RuleEngine` converted from struct to shared singleton actor for thread-safe rule evaluation across proxy handlers; async rule evaluation in HTTPS handler via `makeFutureWithTask`
- `RuleSyncService` centralizes all rule mutations (add, remove, toggle, load) with automatic disk persistence, `BreakpointWindowModel` refresh, and `rulesDidChange` notification broadcasting
- `MainContentCoordinator` rules snapshot kept in sync via `rulesDidChange` notification observer; views read `coordinator.rules` instead of crossing actor boundary
- Breakpoint window two-section sidebar (`BreakpointSidebarView`) showing both breakpoint rules and paused items; `BreakpointWindowModel` tracks selection mode (rule vs paused item) with automatic fallback; `BreakpointEditorView` shows rule detail (pattern, phase, status) or paused-item editor depending on selection; adaptive action bar switches between rule enable/disable/remove and paused-item cancel/abort/execute controls
- `breakpointRuleCreated` notification opens the breakpoints window automatically when a new breakpoint rule is created

### Changed

- Import error dialogs now show specific titles and messages per failure type (size exceeded, invalid format, deserialization error) instead of a generic "Import Failed"
- README roadmap updated: `.rockxy format` corrected to `.rockxysession format`
- Removed iOS Simulator Certificate step from Welcome screen — Community edition ships with 4 steps (Install Cert, Trust Cert, Install Helper, Enable Proxy)
- Hidden Platform settings tab from Community edition; file retained for future use
- Removed "Restore previous proxy settings on quit" toggle from Advanced Settings — restore-on-quit is now mandatory and always-on via persistent backup
- `stopProxy()` no longer gates `disableSystemProxy()` behind `isSystemProxyConfigured` flag — the ownership-aware disable handles all cases internally
- Privacy Settings tab rewritten with honest disclosure: Data Storage locations (SQLite path, large bodies path), Exports & Sharing warning about sensitive content in exports, and Analytics & Telemetry section with "No Data Collected" badge confirming zero telemetry; removed fake analytics/crash report toggles
- MCP Settings tab replaced with informational Labs Preview surface showing feature status and planned capabilities; removed non-functional toggle, status indicator, config snippet, and privacy controls
- HTTP/2 row in General Settings replaced fake "Download..." link with clean informational row showing "Planned" badge
- Certificate inspector placeholder updated to say "planned for a future release" instead of generic "will appear here"

### Fixed

- `SystemProxyWarningBanner` ignored the runtime `message` parameter and always showed hardcoded generic text; now displays the actual warning from the coordinator
- Response breakpoint edits not recorded in transaction — after user edits status/headers/body in response breakpoint, the transaction still showed original server response; now updates `responseHead` and `responseBody` before building the transaction
- Stale `pendingBreakpointPhase` leaked across requests — phase was never cleared after handoff to `UpstreamResponseHandler`, causing subsequent non-breakpoint requests on the same connection to incorrectly pause; now cleared after handoff and defensively at request start
- Context menu and sidebar "Add Breakpoint" bypassed `addRule()` coordinator method, calling `ruleEngine.addRule()` directly and skipping JSON persistence; now routes through `addRule()` so rules are saved to disk
- Quick-add breakpoint via Tools menu gave no visual feedback; now shows a confirmation alert with the matched host/path
- Removed dead `BreakpointViewModel` class superseded by queue-backed `BreakpointManager`; kept shared types (`BreakpointPhase`, `BreakpointDecision`, `BreakpointRequestData`, `EditableHeader`)
- `CertificateStore.saveRootCAPrivateKey` wrote plaintext PEM to disk unconditionally even after successful Keychain save; now only writes disk PEM as fallback when Keychain save fails
- Import size-validation and deserialization errors were silently logged with no user feedback; `openSession()` and `importHAR()` now show an `NSAlert` on failure
- `showAlertOnQuit` preference defaulted to `false` for new users because `UserDefaults.bool(forKey:)` returns `false` for unset keys; registered `true` as the default at launch
- Keychain-dependent certificate tests could fail in sandbox/CI environments; added keychain availability probes that skip gracefully when keychain is inaccessible
- `RuleStore` init crashed with `fatalError` when Application Support directory was unavailable; now falls back to a temporary directory with a logged warning
- "Map API Local" preset rule shipped with hardcoded `~/Desktop/mock.json` path; replaced with empty string so users select a file via Browse
- HTTP breakpoint loses non-default ports — after BreakpointRequestBuilder converts to origin-form, `head.uri` no longer contains port info; port derivation now reads `requestData.url.port` instead of parsing origin-form URI
- Breakpoint Content-Length not reconciled after body edit — editing the request body in the breakpoint sheet left the original Content-Length header intact, causing length mismatches; builder now recomputes Content-Length from actual body bytes and strips Transfer-Encoding
- Map Local directory path containment bypass — sibling directories with a shared prefix (e.g. `/tmp/web-evil` vs `/tmp/web`) could pass the `hasPrefix` check; now enforces trailing-slash boundary in both resolve and loadFile paths
- MCP Settings status indicator falsely showed "Running" when toggle was on despite no MCP server existing; now shows "Enabled (server not available)"
- Map Local info bar claimed "Set status code, headers, and body independently" but only status code is configurable; removed misleading copy
- Breakpoint body forwarding — edited request body in the breakpoint sheet was ignored; both HTTP and HTTPS proxy handlers wrote the original captured body (`self.requestBody`) instead of the edited body from `requestData.body`
- HTTPS breakpoint host header desync — enforce original Host header on HTTPS breakpoint execution so user edits cannot mismatch the established TLS tunnel
- HTTP breakpoint origin-form bug — when `head.uri` was path-only (e.g. `/foo`), the breakpoint sheet showed just the path; `URL(string: "/foo")` has no host so forwarding failed with 400. Now seeds the breakpoint with the full absolute URL from `requestData.url`
- HTTPS breakpoint URL field now constrains editing to path and query only — the scheme+host prefix is shown as non-editable text, preventing user edits that would desync from the TLS tunnel
- HTTP breakpoint scheme-change mismatch — user could type `https://` in the breakpoint URL field for a plain HTTP request, causing the builder to emit a URL whose scheme did not match the cleartext transport; builder now forces the original scheme when `isHTTPS == false`, and the sheet locks the scheme prefix as non-editable for HTTP requests too
- XPC caller validation hardened with two-layer defense-in-depth: existing certificate chain comparison (Pearcleaner pattern) plus new `SecRequirement`-based bundle identity check that pins `com.amunx.Rockxy` identifier with Apple anchor, using audit token for PID-race-resistant caller identification
- Removed dead disabled menu items from Diff menu (Add to Pool, Left Side, Right Side) and Scripting menu (Beautify, Save and Activate) that had no implementation

## 2026-03-20

### Added

- Wire `showAlertOnQuit` setting — AppDelegate now reads `com.amunx.Rockxy.showAlertOnQuit` from UserDefaults and shows a confirmation alert before quitting when enabled
- Settings truth audit — every @AppStorage key across all 4 settings tabs annotated with wiring status (WIRED or DEFERRED) in both doc comments and inline comments
- Import size boundaries — `ImportSizePolicy` validates file sizes before loading HAR (100 MB limit) and session (200 MB limit) imports to prevent OOM/hangs from oversized files
- Map Local Directory support — serve files from an entire local directory instead of a single file, with automatic subpath resolution, index.html fallback, MIME type detection, and path traversal protection
- File/Directory segmented toggle in Map Local rule editor with path resolution preview
- `MapLocalDirectoryResolver` for secure directory-to-URL mapping with symlink resolution and 10 MB file size cap
- Test suite: MapLocalDirectoryResolverTests (12 tests) covering path resolution, index fallback, traversal prevention, MIME detection, symlinks, and size limits
- Allow List — capture-level filter that restricts recording to specific domains only; non-matching traffic is forwarded but not captured
- Allow List window (Tools > Allow List, Cmd+Opt+A) with master toggle, warning banner, domain table with per-entry enable/disable, add/remove/import/export
- "Add to Allow List" / "Remove from Allow List" in sidebar domain context menu
- "Allow List" accent-colored badge in status bar when active
- `AllowListManager` singleton with thread-safe `isHostAllowed(_:)` for NIO access, JSON persistence, import/export
- `AllowListEntry` model with wildcard and exact domain matching
- No Caching toggle — global switch (Tools menu + Settings) injects `Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate` and `Pragma: no-cache` on all outbound requests, strips `If-Modified-Since` and `If-None-Match` conditional headers to force fresh responses from origin servers
- "No Cache" orange status bar badge when No Caching is active
- Breakpoint end-to-end wiring — `.breakpoint` rule action now pauses HTTP and HTTPS requests in the NIO pipeline, presents the breakpoint sheet for user editing, and forwards/aborts/cancels based on decision
- `BreakpointViewModel` moved to `MainContentCoordinator` so both the proxy callback and the sheet view share the same instance

### Changed

- Root CA private key storage is now Keychain-primary with automatic migration from disk PEM; existing disk keys are migrated to Keychain on first load and the PEM file renamed to `.bak` as recovery-only fallback
- Remove zombie certificate buttons (More, Preview, Advanced) in General Settings and replace with functional "Install & Trust" and "Export Certificate" actions
- Wire "Full Changelogs" button in Advanced Settings to GitHub releases page
- Wire "Privacy Policy" button in Privacy Settings to GitHub wiki page
- Replace dead "External Proxy Settings" and "SOCKS Proxy Settings" buttons with a "Planned for Future Release" GroupBox explaining the feature purpose
- Add "Preview" banner to MCP Settings tab indicating the server backend is under development
- Replace generic "Coming Soon" placeholders in GitHub, Platform, and Workspace settings tabs with purposeful descriptions of planned functionality
- Add tooltip to disabled "Check for Updates" menu item

### Fixed

- Fix blank main window visible behind welcome screen on first launch — welcome is now a `.sheet` on the main `ContentView` instead of a separate window, eliminating the `Color.clear` placeholder and preventing duplicate windows

## 2026-03-19

### Added

- Multiple workspace tabs — open independent debugging workspaces in tabs (Cmd+T new tab, Cmd+W close, Cmd+1-9 switch)
- Each workspace tab has its own filter criteria, selection, sidebar scope, and inspector state
- "Open in New Tab" context menu on domain and app rows in sidebar
- Tab strip UI with close, duplicate, rename (double-click), and "Close Other Tabs" context menu
- Previous/Next tab navigation (Cmd+Shift+[/])
- "Copy as" submenu: Request Headers, Response Headers, Request Body, Response Body, Request Cookies, Response Cookies
- "Copy URL" in Edit menu (Cmd+C) for selected request
- `RequestCopyFormatter` — pure formatter layer for all copy-to-clipboard formats with proper shell escaping
- Custom Previewer Tabs — user-configurable body preview tabs in request/response inspector (JSON Treeview, HTML Preview, Hex, Raw, CSS, JavaScript, XML, Images, Form URL-Encoded)
- "+" button on inspector tab bars opens panel-scoped popover to toggle preview tabs
- Custom Previewer Tabs settings window (Tools menu) as secondary global defaults surface
- `PreviewRenderer` — pure rendering engine for all preview formats with hex dump, JSON tree, HTML/CSS/JS beautify
- Custom Header Columns settings window (Tools menu) — add request/response header columns to the flow table
- `RequestCopyFormatter.cellValue` resolves custom header column values via `HeaderColumnStore`
- Auto-discover headers from captured traffic — settings view shows discovered headers as unchecked items alongside stored columns
- Built-in column visibility toggles in column header right-click menu (Status, #, URL, Client, Method, Code, Time, Duration, Size, Query Name)
- Hidden built-in column state persisted to UserDefaults
- Discovered headers persisted to UserDefaults across app restarts
- "Manage Header Columns..." menu action opens Custom Columns settings window
- Settings window merges stored and discovered headers into a unified checkbox list
- Tests for header discovery persistence, built-in column visibility toggle, and persistence

### Changed

- Cmd+T now opens a new workspace tab (was "New Session", moved to Cmd+Shift+N)
- Cmd+1-9 now switch workspace tabs (MainTab shortcuts moved to Ctrl+1-5)

### Fixed

- Discovered headers lost on app restart — now saved to UserDefaults
- Header discovery only ran every 100 transactions — now runs on every batch
- "Manage Header Columns..." notification had no listener — ContentView now opens the settings window
- Table layout not refreshed after toggling built-in column visibility
- Settings window only showed stored columns, not discovered headers
- Fix search field selection ignored — filtering always searched URL regardless of field picker selection
- Fix "Save Session…" menu item exporting HAR instead of saving native Rockxy session format
- Fix Chrome `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` — add SHA-256 fingerprint-based root CA identity, clean up stale duplicate Rockxy roots from keychain before trust installation
- Remove `keyEncipherment` from ECDSA leaf cert KeyUsage — semantically wrong for ECDHE key exchange, BoringSSL (Chrome) may reject
- Add fail-closed trust validation at proxy start — warn when root CA is not trusted so HTTPS interception falls back to raw tunnel instead of producing cert errors
- Harden root CA regeneration — clear host cert cache when root changes, stop swallowing `ensureRootCA()` errors with `try?` at app launch
- Detect port conflicts before proxy bind — report which process owns the port instead of a generic NIO bind failure
- Replace 60-second connection lifetime cap with idle timeout that resets on data activity (300s) — fixes premature termination of CONNECT tunnels, WebSocket, and long-lived HTTPS connections
- Fix TLS handshake race condition where both success and error handlers fire on the same channel — add `handshakeResolved` guard to `PostHandshakeHandler` so only one path executes
- Fix XPC stale connection reuse after error or timeout — invalidate and nil the cached connection on `remoteObjectProxyWithErrorHandler` error, add `resetConnection()` for explicit cleanup
- Increase helper re-registration wait from 0.5s to 2s and reset XPC connection before availability check — fixes "registered but not responding" loop
- Stop restoring system proxy on transient XPC interruptions — only CrashRecovery handles proxy restore now, preventing proxy instability from brief reconnects
- Add SubjectKeyIdentifier extension to host certificates for proper TLS chain building alongside AuthorityKeyIdentifier
- Add post-install trust verification in KeychainHelper — immediately checks if admin trust settings were actually applied after `installRootCAWithTrust`, warns if user dismissed the auth dialog
- Fix `reinstallPlugin()` attempting to install from already-deleted bundle path — now copies plugin to temp directory before uninstall
- Path traversal protection for Map Local rules — `MapLocalFileValidator` resolves symlinks, validates file existence/readability, and enforces 10 MB size cap before serving
- Rule import rejects files larger than 5 MB to prevent memory exhaustion
- Plugin install validates source is a directory containing `plugin.json` and sanitizes directory names
- Fix crash after long running (`HTTPServerProtocolErrorHandler` precondition failure) — guard all HTTP response writes with `channel.isActive` checks in UpstreamResponseHandler timeout, TLSInterceptHandler sendBlockResponse, sendErrorResponse, and HTTPProxyHandler sendErrorResponse
- Auto-passthrough for strict TLS clients — hosts that reject Rockxy's intercepted certificate (e.g., ChatGPT, certificate-pinned apps) are automatically routed through raw tunnel on subsequent connections, with 5-minute TTL before retrying interception
- Fall back to raw tunnel when certificate generation fails instead of closing the channel and breaking traffic
- Fix proxy blocking all internet traffic after ~5 minutes — close client channel after error responses (`Connection: close` header + explicit channel close), close leaked NIO channels on all error paths, add connection limiter to raw tunnel paths
- Revert harmful `Connection: close` on successful responses — restore HTTP/1.1 keep-alive semantics so browsers reuse connections instead of opening one per request
- Wire pinned transactions into sidebar "Pinned" section — clicking Pin in context menu now shows the request in the sidebar
- Wire sidebar selection to request list filtering — clicking a domain or app in the sidebar filters the request list
- Display user-added favorites (domains/apps) in sidebar favorites section
- Fix "Save this Request" context menu action to toggle saved state for sidebar persistence
- Persist pinned and saved transactions to SQLite — pinned/saved requests survive app restarts via schema migration (is_pinned, is_saved, comment, highlight_color, client_app columns)
- Add per-destination connection limit (max 6 concurrent) to prevent unbounded FD growth under heavy traffic
- Add 60-second idle timeout to raw tunnel handler to prevent indefinite FD consumption on hung connections
- Reduce connection lifetime timeout from 120s to 60s for faster zombie connection cleanup
- Fix Chrome `ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID` by removing self-signed root CA from TLS certificate chain — serve leaf-only chain per RFC 5246, matching mitmproxy behavior
- Fix app crash after ~40 minutes of capture — add eviction observer for `bufferEvictionRequested` notification to remove oldest transactions and rebuild sidebar indexes
- Fix `-34018` trust write failure by moving root CA install/verify/cleanup to privileged helper tool (runs as root) instead of unprivileged app process
- Fail closed for HTTPS when root CA is untrusted — force global passthrough mode so CONNECT requests tunnel raw instead of producing cert errors
- Fix NIO resource leak — guard `certFuture.whenComplete` with `channel.isActive` check, cancel pending throttle tasks in `handlerRemoved()`
- Fix Chrome privacy interstitial on first TLS rejection — downgrade same connection to raw passthrough instead of closing, so cert-pinned hosts (Google, LinkedIn, etc.) work without user intervention
- Fix `RecentFailureTracker` crash during high-volume TLS failures — move timestamp capture inside lock to prevent `UInt64` underflow race between concurrent NIO event loops
- Fix helper tool version mismatch causing spurious uninstall/reinstall cycles on startup
- Persist auto-passthrough hosts across app restarts (24-hour TTL) — hosts that reject MITM certs are remembered so subsequent sessions skip interception immediately
- Fix helper trust install failing with `-60007` (`errAuthorizationInteractionNotAllowed`) — split cert install: helper adds to system keychain (works from root), app sets trust (has GUI context for macOS auth dialog)
- Fix VPN/tunnel no-capture not surfaced when using helper tool — move VPN detection before helper/networksetup branch so warning banner always appears when default route is `utun`/`ppp`/`tun`
- Fix helper proxy backup saving settings for wrong network service — detect primary service via route table instead of using `services.first`
- Make keychain private key save non-fatal — disk storage is primary, keychain is backup recovery path
- Stop treating all pre-handshake TLS errors as permanent host-level MITM rejection — classify BoringSSL errors, only persist auto-passthrough for confirmed certificate-trust rejections (not timeouts, resets, or protocol errors)
- Fix misleading certificate chain diagnostic — add `validateSystemTrust()` that tests generated certs against real macOS trust store without injecting root CA as explicit anchor

## 2026-03-18

- Transaction highlight colors (red/orange/yellow/green/blue/purple) with tinted row background
- Transaction pinning (isPinned property on HTTPTransaction)

## 2026-03-17

### Added

- User-Agent app identification — extract app names (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge, curl, Slack, etc.) from HTTP User-Agent headers at capture time, providing instant app identification without waiting for lsof process resolution
- TLS failure suppression — duplicate TLS handshake failures for cert-pinned hosts (e.g., `gateway.icloud.com`) are suppressed within a 30-second window, showing only the first failure per host
- Column auto-sizing — double-click column dividers to fit content; URL and Client columns auto-size on first data load
- Process identification via `lsof` — resolve which macOS app (Safari, Chrome, `trustd`, `cloudd`, etc.) made each proxy connection by mapping TCP source ports to PIDs, with 2-second batch caching
- Real macOS app icons in sidebar — resolve app icons via `NSWorkspace` bundle ID lookup with gradient monogram fallback

### Changed

- `filteredTransactions` converted from computed property to cached stored property — eliminates O(n) re-filtering on every SwiftUI view evaluation (was running twice per batch delivery)
- Batch timer interval increased from 100ms to 250ms — reduces UI update frequency from 10/sec to 4/sec, producing larger batches instead of 1-2 transaction micro-batches
- Text cells in request list now vertically centered using container NSView pattern (same as status dot and client icon) — fixes NSTableView overriding direct cell view frames
- Batch delivery decoupled from lsof — process resolution now runs asynchronously after batch is delivered, eliminating 50-200ms blocking per cache miss
- Double GraphQL detection removed — JSON parsing now runs once per request (in HTTPProxyHandler) instead of twice
- Auto-analysis throttled to every 10 seconds with 500-transaction threshold (was 2s/100) — reduces MainActor contention during high traffic
- Incremental `appendFilteredTransactions()` fast path — when no user filters are active, new transactions are appended directly instead of re-scanning all transactions O(n)
- Column auto-sizing deferred via `DispatchQueue.main.async` to avoid blocking `updateNSView` hot path
- Process resolution moved off main thread — `lsof` calls now run in `TrafficSessionManager` actor with async dispatch, eliminating 50-200ms main thread blocking per cache miss
- Process resolution cache TTL increased from 2s to 5s — TCP ports reuse slowly, reducing lsof invocations
- Request list row height increased from 22pt to 28pt — better vertical centering and visual breathing room
- NSTableView cell reuse for status dot and client cells — eliminates per-row view allocation during scrolling
- TLS failure transactions hidden from traffic list by default — reduces noise from cert-pinned hosts
- Helper tool auto-updates on version mismatch — `HelperManager.checkStatus()` detects outdated helper and triggers uninstall/reinstall cycle automatically instead of requiring manual update
- System proxy now configures all enabled network services instead of a single detected service, matching Charles/Proxyman behavior
- Detect primary network interface via routing table (`route -n get 0.0.0.0`) for accurate diagnostics
- Add TCP connection logging to proxy server NIO pipeline for connection-level diagnostics
- Upgrade helper tool status logging from debug to info level for Xcode console visibility
- Re-check helper tool status before each proxy start to pick up installs done during welcome flow
- Welcome window now opens as a separate window (Xcode-style) instead of replacing main window content
- Helper tool binary moved to `Contents/MacOS/` with embedded Info.plist, matching SMAppService reference pattern
- Helper tool XPC validation uses certificate chain comparison instead of team-ID-from-plist, removing build configuration dependency
- Certificate install button now updates immediately after successful install (optimistic state update)
- Wire PluginSettingsViewModel to ScriptPluginManager for real plugin loading, reload, and uninstall
- Cookie inspector now shows full request/response cookie details (name, value, domain, path, secure, expiry)
- App termination now properly cleans up system proxy settings before exiting
- Proxy start/stop now triggers log capture lifecycle automatically
- Rules are now persisted to disk after every add/remove/toggle mutation
- ContentView initializes favorites and auto-starts proxy on launch when configured
- Sidebar section headers now use colored text (amber for Favorites, gray for All/Analytics) with increased header prominence
- App icons in sidebar replaced with colored gradient rounded squares showing the app's first letter
- Sidebar SF Symbol icons updated to filled variants matching Proxyman (pin.fill, tray.full.fill, square.stack.3d.up.fill, exclamationmark.triangle.fill)
- Added Theme.Sidebar color definitions for section headers and app icon gradients
- Incremental `NSTableView` updates — use `insertRows(at:)` for append-only batches instead of full `reloadData()`, eliminating UI jank on high-traffic sessions
- O(1) domain tree lookup — dictionary-backed index replaces O(n) `firstIndex(where:)` scan per transaction
- Cached sidebar `appNodes` — incrementally updated in `processBatch()` instead of recomputing from all transactions on every render
- Move GraphQL detection to `TrafficSessionManager` actor — runs on background thread instead of blocking main thread during batch processing
- Time-throttled auto-analytics — max once per 2 seconds instead of every 100 transactions
- Proxy server now runs independently of system proxy — matches Proxyman behavior where system proxy is best-effort
- Proxy toolbar pill shows orange when system proxy is not configured
- `stopProxy()` now guards against re-entry to prevent race conditions with double cleanup

### Security

- Helper tool ConnectionValidator now compares code signing certificate chains instead of relying on build-time team ID injection — self-referencing, zero-configuration, immune to Info.plist tampering

### Fixed

- TLS failure transactions now hidden even when no user filters are active — previously the `isTLSFailure` check was inside the filter block that only ran when filters were set
- Fix proxy blocking all internet traffic — add 5-second connection timeouts to all upstream `ClientBootstrap` calls, 30-second read timeout to `UpstreamResponseHandler`, and 120-second max connection lifetime to prevent hung connections from exhausting resources
- Fix leaked connections on failed TLS handshakes — `PostHandshakeHandler.errorCaught` now closes the channel after recording the failed transaction (was leaving it open with `autoRead = false`, leaking one connection per cert-pinned host)
- Fix lost HTTPS transactions when upstream server closes without TLS `close_notify` — complete and record the transaction from whatever response data was already received instead of silently dropping it
- Fix failed TLS handshakes (cert pinning) invisible in UI — record as failed transactions so they appear in the request list like Proxyman
- Fix noisy `uncleanShutdown` errors flooding console — handle as normal TLS connection close, downgrade upstream close log from error to debug
- Fix HTTPS interception "EOF during handshake" on all connections — change root CA trust from `.user` to `.admin` domain so Safari, Chrome, and system services honor the trust setting; include root CA in server certificate chain for macOS TLS compatibility; replay buffered TLS data after async pipeline reconfiguration to prevent ClientHello loss; add SecTrust chain validation diagnostic at proxy startup
- Fix CONNECT tunnel TLS handshake failure (`WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER`) — replace broken `channel.pipeline.fireChannelRead` replay with forward-based `ProtocolDetectorHandler` that sits before NIOSSLServerHandler and forwards TLS data naturally via `context.fireChannelRead`
- Fix incomplete HTTP pipeline teardown leaving `NIOHTTPResponseHeadersValidator` in the channel after CONNECT
- Fix HTTPS interception TLS handshake failing on all browsers — add `Content-Length: 0` to CONNECT 200 response so NIO's HTTPResponseEncoder uses identity encoding instead of chunked; without this, the chunked terminator bytes (`0\r\n\r\n`) corrupt the TLS handshake stream (browsers don't consume body after CONNECT 200 per RFC 7231 §4.3.6)
- Fix HTTPS interception TLS handshake failing with "EOF during handshake" — add `SubjectKeyIdentifier` to root CA and `AuthorityKeyIdentifier` to per-host leaf certs so macOS SecTrust can build the certificate chain (mitmproxy `dummy_cert` pattern)
- Fix HTTPS MITM fatal crash ("tried to decode as HTTPPart but found IOData") — place `NIOSSLServerHandler` at pipeline `.first` position so outbound TLS bytes go directly to socket, add belt-and-suspenders HTTP codec removal in `installTLSHandlers`, and defer HTTP codec installation until after `TLSUserEvent.handshakeCompleted` via `PostHandshakeHandler`
- Fix "certificate not yet valid" errors with clock skew — backdate `notValidBefore` by 2 days on both root CA and per-host certs (mitmproxy pattern)
- Fix potential DER/BoringSSL incompatibility in per-host certificate generation — switch certificate and private key serialization from DER to PEM format for NIOSSL
- Auto-regenerate root CA on launch if missing `SubjectKeyIdentifier` extension (added in this release)
- Fix helper auto-update "Operation not permitted" after unregister — catch BTM re-approval failure gracefully, set status to `.requiresApproval`, and open System Settings for user to re-approve
- Fix ChannelError 5 (outputClosed) during TLS interception — client no longer times out waiting for ServerHello because buffered data is replayed immediately after cert generation completes
- Fix invalid context use after handler removal in TLS pipeline — capture `channel` reference before `removeHandler` and use `channel.close()` instead of `context.close()`
- Fix helper tool always reporting "notInstalled" despite SMAppService `.enabled` — remove `setCodeSigningRequirement("anchor apple generic")` which rejects all development-signed builds; certificate chain comparison (matching Pearcleaner pattern) is the sole validation mechanism
- Fix helper tool version check always failing — hardcode expected version in `HelperManager` to match `HelperService.version` (Xcode's `INFOPLIST_KEY_` prefix only maps Apple-defined keys, not custom ones)
- Fix XPC continuation leak ("SWIFT TASK CONTINUATION MISUSE: getHelperVersion() leaked its continuation") — flatten nested `withXPCTimeout`/`withCheckedThrowingContinuation` into a single continuation per XPC call with inline timeout racing in the same lock scope
- Fix stale helper registration after Xcode rebuild — add Pearcleaner-style recovery (unregister → 500ms → re-register) when SMAppService reports `.enabled` but XPC doesn't respond
- Fix helper tool only configuring proxy on one network service — rewrite `ProxyConfigurator` to set proxy on ALL enabled services (matching SystemProxyManager Phase 2 fix), restore also disables all services
- Fix HTTPS TLS handshake failing on every CONNECT tunnel — add `RemovableChannelHandler` conformance to `HTTPProxyHandler` and `TLSInterceptHandler`, and reorder pipeline swap to remove application handler before HTTP codecs (matching NIO's own upgrade pattern)
- Fix Welcome screen appearing on every launch despite trusted cert — ensure root CA is loaded into memory before checking trust status, eliminating race with AppDelegate's background Task
- Fix frozen Start button — remove blocking `HelperManager.checkStatus()` from proxy startup path
- Fix XPC timeout hanging forever — replace `withThrowingTaskGroup` with unstructured timeout pattern so stuck XPC continuations don't block the app
- Fix system proxy set on wrong network interface causing zero traffic capture — configure proxy on all enabled services instead of single detected service
- Fix blank main window after clicking "Get Started" in welcome — add welcomeDidComplete notification to reset needsWelcome state
- Fix both windows showing simultaneously on first launch — consolidate welcome window management in MainWindowContent only
- Detect VPN/tunnel primary interface (utun, ppp) and show warning banner that traffic may not be captured
- Fix HTTPS traffic not captured — remove HTTP codecs from NIO pipeline before CONNECT tunnel transition to TLS; without this, TLS ClientHello bytes were misinterpreted as HTTP
- Fix empty SSL Proxying List blocking all HTTPS interception — default to intercept-all when no rules configured, matching Proxyman behavior
- Fix helper tool always showing "notInstalled" — check SMAppService status at app startup so `SystemProxyManager` reads accurate helper state
- Fix welcome screen showing on every launch — load root CA certificate into memory before checking trust status on startup
- Fix traffic not displaying — await session manager setup before proxy server starts accepting connections, preventing race condition where `onBatchReady` callback was nil
- Fix 10-second silent delay when helper tool is not installed — check `HelperManager.status` before attempting XPC, skip directly to networksetup fallback
- Fix invisible helper availability logging — upgrade from `.debug` to `.info` level so XPC results appear in Xcode console
- Add diagnostic logging to certificate trust and installation checks (DER vs label-fallback path visibility)
- Fix proxy stopping immediately after start — system proxy failure no longer kills the proxy server; proxy keeps running with warning banner instead of rollback
- Fix helper tool "Operation not permitted" — embedded Info.plist section in binary so `codesign` identifier matches launchd plist Label
- Fix Welcome screen not showing when setup is incomplete — now checks cert trust status in addition to `showWelcomeOnLaunch` flag
- Fix main window showing behind Welcome window on first launch — main window hidden until setup completes
- Rule engine: mapRemote action now forwards requests to the remapped host instead of silently completing
- Rule engine: modifyHeader action now forwards the modified request to upstream instead of dropping it
- Rule engine: throttle action now delays forwarding by the configured milliseconds instead of silently completing
- HTTPS proxy relay now evaluates rules (block, mapLocal, mapRemote, throttle, modifyHeader) — previously HTTPS requests bypassed all rules
- TLS handshake timing no longer hardcoded to 0; HTTPS connections now report approximate TCP/TLS split
- WebSocket upgrade detection now wired into UpstreamResponseHandler — 101 Switching Protocols triggers pipeline reconfiguration
