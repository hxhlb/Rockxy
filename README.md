## Latest Release

**v0.9.0** — 2026-04-18

### Fixed

- Align live-history cap with actor accounting, guard clearSession reentry, clear ruleLoadTask on completion
- Finalize upstream normalization cleanup
- Cross-suite RuleEngine serialization via RuleTestLock and clearSession regression test
- Replace fire-and-forget engine restore with awaited cleanup in rule tests
- Eliminate MainActor starvation in rule tests and close clearSession generation gap
- Synchronous sessionGeneration in clearSession, atomic rule store writes, and detached syncAll disk I/O
- ClearSession generation sync, deterministic rollback polls, and test isolation
- ClearSession race, rule test isolation, and docs product-name normalization
- Testable ConnectionValidator seam with accept-path and audit-token coverage
- Generation-safe accepted-count reporting and audit-token SecCode extraction seam
- Real caller-validation entrypoint, generation-safe session clear, and bridge defaults isolation
- Real caller-validation tests, correct history accounting, and full plugin environment normalization
- Session clear race, plugin environment normalization, and test serialization
- Hermetic plugin test isolation, real runtime transition test, and error-status assertion
- Refresh VM on failed enable, isolate plugin fixtures, guard small-buffer eviction, and tighten signing tests
- Use Task.sleep instead of Task.yield for VM rollback test stability
- Single-flight rule loading via ensureRulesLoaded()
- Harden plugin/rule race conditions, quota logic, and error surfacing
- Short-circuit re-enable for already-enabled plugins
- Snapshot plugin IDs across await and fix exclusive netcond quota
- Rule loading race and exclusive network-condition quota bypass
- Make quota paths truly atomic and isolate gate policy from tests
- Address final review findings for gates, bulk replace, and selection
- Make script enable atomic and propagate missing-plugin errors
- Address review findings for policy gate correctness
- Make RuleQuotaTests immune to cross-suite singleton state

### Changed

- Correct batched-update interval to 100ms and qualify large-body storage path per build
- Validate loadInitialRules reuses in-flight ruleLoadTask and clears it on completion
- Harden plugin env cleanup, dedupe allowed-caller constants, remove hardcoded audit_token_t ObjC encoding, guarantee rule lock release
- Delegate RockxyIdentity bundle init to infoDictionary init
- Tighten .gitignore entries, fix README badges, correct architecture and security diagrams
- Exercise real audit-token revalidation branch in isValidCaller
- Full isValidCaller accept path and NSValue audit-token branch via TestXPCConnection
- Stabilize ConnectionValidator tests and remove infeasible XPC harness
- Direct ConnectionValidator coverage via Shared/ relocation
- Prove enable transition through real default-init production singleton
- Prove default-init VMs load consistent state through real production path
- Restore default-init wiring coverage via pluginManagerIdentity seam
- Isolate default-wiring plugin test from real app-support state
- Complete helper signing diagnostics, toggle rollback, and engine-state assertions
- Strengthen actor eviction, default VM wiring, and concurrent enable postconditions
- Cover default plugin runtime wiring
- Cover coordinator rule wiring, VM quota rollback, and script default paths
- Extract shared temp plugin helpers to TestFixtures
- Remove dead SessionStore coupling from eviction and strengthen history retention tests
- Add helper caller validation matrix
- Annotate identity fallbacks and bind tests to live config
- Add identity and helper trust matrix coverage
- Unify ScriptPluginManager ownership and add script quota
- Cap live history buffer at policy-defined limit
- Add RulePolicyGate and route rule mutations through it
- Add domain favorites capacity at coordinator boundary
- Inject workspace capacity via init
- Remove edition leakage and introduce AppPolicy
- Split family config from product identity

## Features

**Traffic Capture** — SwiftNIO proxy with CONNECT tunnel, auto-generated per-host TLS certificates, WebSocket frame capture, and automatic GraphQL operation detection.

**Inspect Everything** — JSON tree viewer, hex inspector, timing waterfall (DNS/TCP/TLS/TTFB/Transfer), headers, cookies, query params, auth — all in a tabbed inspector.

**Mock & Modify** — Map Local (serve from files), Map Remote (redirect to another server), Breakpoints (pause and edit mid-flight), Block, Throttle, Modify Headers, Allow List, Bypass Proxy.

**Log Correlation** — Capture macOS logs (OSLog) and correlate them with network requests by timestamp. See which app made each request.

**Extend with Plugins** — JavaScript scripting in a sandboxed JavaScriptCore runtime. Inspect, modify, and automate traffic with custom hooks.

**Built for Scale** — NSTableView virtual scrolling handles 100k+ requests. Ring buffer eviction, disk body offloading, batched UI updates. Zero lag.

> 100% native macOS. No Electron. No web views. SwiftUI + AppKit + SwiftNIO.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LocNguyenHuu/Rockxy.git
cd Rockxy
open Rockxy.xcodeproj
```

Build and run in Xcode. The Welcome window guides you through root CA setup, helper installation, and proxy activation.

**Requirements:** macOS 14.0+, Xcode 16+, Swift 5.9

## Security

Rockxy intercepts network traffic — security is foundational, not optional.

- XPC helper validates callers via **certificate-chain comparison**, not just bundle ID
- Plugins run in **sandboxed JavaScriptCore** with 5-second timeout, no filesystem/network access
- **Input validation** on all boundaries — body size caps, URI limits, regex DoS protection, path traversal prevention
- Credentials **automatically redacted** in captured logs
- Sensitive files stored with **0o600 permissions**

Report vulnerabilities via [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). See the [full security architecture](docs/development/security.mdx) for details.

## Roadmap

- [x] HTTP/HTTPS/WebSocket/GraphQL interception
- [x] Map Local, Map Remote, Breakpoints, Block, Throttle
- [x] JavaScript plugin system with sandboxed execution
- [x] HAR import/export, native session files, request diff
- [x] OSLog correlation and credential redaction
